[B][SIZE=4][COLOR=darkorange]I guess there is nothing wrong in reading facts![/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]

[SPOILER][SIZE=4]-[COLOR=red]Why no "Incremental/Delta updates" Support?[/COLOR]
->The updates we provide monthly are heavily changed and modified than the previous builds. New stuff is merged and added. So we don't provide incremental updates and recommend a clean flash.

-[COLOR=Red]How do I root this ROM?[/COLOR]
->We recommend [URL='https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445']Magisk[/URL]

-[COLOR=Red]Which Gapps are recommended?[/COLOR]
->OpenGApps and NikGApps

-[COLOR=Red]Will this ROM relock the bootloader?[/COLOR]
->No.

-[COLOR=red]When Will Be the Next Update?[/COLOR]
->No ETAs, please. ROM Will be updated whenever the new build is ready by your maintainer. We generally provide monthly updates with the latest security patches and new features.

-[COLOR=red]Adaway is not working :([/COLOR]
->Download it from here [URL='https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2190753']Adaway[/URL]

-[COLOR=red]SElinux Linux mode changer app is not working nor Busy Box installer app is working.[/COLOR]
->Everything is good with the sources. You should try other things first and then contact your maintainer.[/SIZE]
