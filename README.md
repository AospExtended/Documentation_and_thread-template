![bannar7](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AospExtended/Documentation_and_thread-template/9.x/PieBanner.png)


Maintainers are asked to follow the guidelines mentioned here and for the thread template. Always take at least two reserved posts! Be respectful to users. If any fuss is created report us before doing anything. 

If you wish to maintain your device officially then you must fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSd3RyjUjb-QAMh231KXlZFipLgFjDlhFCnHS4tptlwlnI_7-w/viewform?usp=pp_url) and provide all details mention in form. But before applying for the official maintainership, you need to go through our [Official maintainer's rules/guidelines here](https://github.com/AospExtended/Documentation_and_thread-template/blob/9.x/Maintainers_Rules.md). You need to strictly comply with our rules.

You can contact us on telegram at @FireLord1, @ishubhamsingh, @AmolAmrit or @allstargaurav. Do not contact more than one developer at a time. If you have any issues with building and if you want to ask anything related to it, feel free to hit us up!

We have website, where Official Builds are posted. So if you are an official maintainer then create a pull request for it, [Apply for Official devices](https://github.com/AospExtended/official_devices). Go through the ReadMe in Official Devices repo and add your data in the .json file accordingly. Submit these info ASAP, once you are allowed to maintain your device officially for AospExtended OS.

Our OTA app has a feature to give device specific changelogs! You can go here [Device official builds & changelog](https://github.com/AospExtended-Devices/official_builds) to upload changelogs. Please read the ReadMe file once to understand the structure before you fill in your data. For each new version, you need to upload the changelog to this repository in the device specific folder.

Coming to the next part, is our [Gerrit Code Review](http://gerrit.aospextended.com/) system. We introduced this system with our Oreo source [It is to be noted that developers can push patches for our 7.x Nougat branch also]. We got a lot of support from other developers and maintainers in Nougat and hence we have our gerrit running.
Pushing patches on gerrit is very easy. You need to have an account on our gerrit obviously and you need to link your SSH keys which you have with you on your build-server or your build-machine with your gerrit account. Once you have done that you are all set with your gerrit log-in set-up.
Here we are linking you a very clean user friendly manual, go through the index properly and know your stuff properly! [Gerrit Manual for AospExtended OS](http://gerrit.aospextended.com/Documentation/intro-user.html)

**Note:** You can push patches for Official Devices repo on our gerrit too.
