[B][SIZE="4"][COLOR="DarkOrange"]I guess there is nothing wrong in reading facts![/COLOR][/SIZE][/B]

[HIDE][SIZE="3"][B]-[COLOR="red"]Why no "Incremental/Delta updates" Support?[/COLOR]
->The updates we provide monthly are heavily changed and modified than the previous builds. New stuff is merged and added. So we don't provide incremental updates and recommend a clean flash.

-[COLOR="Red"]How do I root this ROM?[/COLOR]
->We recommend [URL="https://forum.xda-developers.com/apps/magisk/official-magisk-v7-universal-systemless-t3473445"]Magisk[/URL]

 -[COLOR="Red"]Does this ROM Support Substratum?[/COLOR]
->Google killed Substratum support in Pie. You can use it, however, you need to be rooted. We don't support rootless Substratum.

-[COLOR="Red"]Which Gapps are recommended?[/COLOR]
->OpenGapps and BitGappps

-[COLOR="Red"]Will this ROM relock the bootloader?[/COLOR]
->No.

-[COLOR="Red"]What about XPOSED?[/COLOR]
->XPOSED is still in the beta stage. We like Xposed but it messes up with the system so before giving any bug reports make sure you have Xposed uninstalled.

-[COLOR="red"]When Will Be the Next Update?[/COLOR]
->No ETAs, please. ROM Will be updated whenever the new build is ready by your maintainer. We generally provide monthly updates with the latest security patches and new features.

-[COLOR="red"]Adaway is not working :([/COLOR]
->Download it from here [URL="https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2190753"]Adaway[/URL]

-[COLOR="red"]SElinux Linux mode changer app is not working nor Busy Box installer app is working.[/COLOR]
->Everything is good with the sources. You should try other things first and then contact your maintainer.
