[HIDE][SIZE="3"][B]-[COLOR="Red"]Base Of the  ROM & Version?[/COLOR]
->Rom is based on AOSP

-[COLOR="red"]Why no "Incremental updates" Support?[/COLOR]
->Actually the updates we provide monthly are heavily changed and modified than the previous builds. New stuffs are merged and added. So we don't provide incremental updates and recommend clean flash.
 
 -[COLOR="Red"]Does this ROM Support Substratum/CMTE?[/COLOR]
->Yes, full Substratum support!
  
-[COLOR="Red"]Which Gapps are recommended?[/COLOR]
->OpenGapps or
->BeansGApps
    
-[COLOR="Red"]Will this ROM relock the bootloader?[/COLOR]
->No.
 
-[COLOR="Red"]What about XPOSED?[/COLOR]
->XPOSED For N is not out yet. Still in development. We like Xposed but it messes up with the system so before giving any bug reports make sure you have xposed uninstalled.
  
-[COLOR="red"]When Will Be the Next Update?[/COLOR]
->No ETAs please. ROM Will be updated whenever the new build is ready. We generally provide monthly updates with latest security patches and new features.
 
-[COLOR="red"]I am facing FCs, Bugs, Some feature is broken?[/COLOR]
->Provide full info about your problem with logcats and the procedure to reproduce it.
